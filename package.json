I found myself repeatedly building very similar CMS's across the organizations I've built sites for so I decided to abstract most of it into a single project. This will be a constant work in progress. It's also an excuse for me to try Typescript, so bear with me - the TS might be kind of sloppy, but I'll work on it.",
