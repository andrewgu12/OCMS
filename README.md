OCMS: Organization Content Manager System
===================================================
A CMS I built meant to help manage organization's sites. I found myself repeatedly building very similar CMS's across the organizations I've built sites for so I decided to abstract most of it into a single project. This will be a constant work in progress. It's also an excuse for me to try Typescript, so bear with me - the TS might be kind of sloppy, but I'll work on it. 

Technologies used: Pug, SASS, Typescript, React.js, MongoDB

I'll eventually find a better name for it, but OCMS works for now xD
